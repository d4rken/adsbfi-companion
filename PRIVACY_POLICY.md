# Privacy policy

This is the privacy policy for the Android app "adsb.fi Companion".

## Preamble

I do not collect, share or sell personal information.

My underlying privacy principle is the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

## Debug log

The app has a debug log feature that can be used to assist troubleshooting efforts.
This feature creates a log file that contains verbose output of what the app is doing.

It is manually triggered by the user through an option in the app settings.
The recorded log file can be shared through compatible apps (e.g. your email app) using the system's share dialog.
As this log file may contain sensitive information (e.g. details about files or your installed applications) it should
only be shared with trusted parties.
